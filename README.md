<h2>Code Snippets Illustrating algorithm or API</h2>

<i>Find_indices</i> is an IPython notebook that illustrates how to go about optimising a fairly simple problem.
The particular problem is of 
little use in "real" life. But it shows how one can write a brute force solution and then optimise it -- a practice that will
serve all programmers in good steed. Given that the vast majority of code is used rarely if at all more than once, there is in 
general no point in optimising code. Correctness and ease of understanding is more important.
